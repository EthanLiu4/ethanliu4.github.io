### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

   Lab 4, part 2 was my favorite part of the lab to work on because I love the game Hi-Lo. Now having worked on it and know how it works to a certain degree, I have a new found appreciation for the game even more now! I understand how to correctly use if, else, and integers.

* Lab 2

   Although a little basic, I appreciated lab 2's madlib. The lab laid out the foundation of reading and printing prompts and statements with the use of cin and cout. In addition to reading and printing, this lab showed the importance of formatting lines of code.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7 made heavy use of if and else along with true and false statements to determine proper parking times.This lab was difficult in trying to determine times of the day, months, and days. In addition to previously mentioned statements, the use of "==" to determine true statements was frequently utilized.
